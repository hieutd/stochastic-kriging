Step-by-step instruction how to run compile and run the kriging application

1. Install the MATLAB compiler runtime library
- go to kriging-matlab-code/se.sics.kriging.core/distrib
- run the mcr.bin

2. Install the JAR files for the MATLAB wrapper class into the local maven repository
- go to kriging-matlab-code/se.sics.kriging.core.distrib
- run the script mvn_install.sh

3. Compile the kriging project
- go to stochastic-kriging/
- mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

4. Build the executable jar file
- go to stochastic-kriging/kriging-application
- run mvn assembly:assembly

5. Create the run script with the correct MATLAB lib path
- go to stochastic-kriging/kriging-application
- open the kriging-run.sh
- change the $MCR_ROOT to the correct local path in which the MATLAB Runtime lib was installed

6. Start the application using the script

7. Compile the executor daemon
- go to stochastic-kriging/executor
- run mvn assembly:assembly

8. start the executor daemon on all the client machines
- copy the executor daemon to the targeted machines
- syntax: java -jar executor.jar [name | address] [port]

9. start the experiment
- copy the simulation jar file to the same folder where the daemons are located.
